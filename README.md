# UrgeHolidays
This project is a full-stack automation system where the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend automation is handled using n8n. The system allows users to submit data from a web form, which automatically triggers workflows on the backend.  The backend is deployed on a VPS server using Docker, secured with HTTPS (SSL),
# 🚀 Automation Workflow System (Frontend + n8n Backend)
